                There is no easy answer for this. When I am pricing a website, there are many factors that play in. What
                features should the website have, and generally the size. With this I mean how many pages and sub pages
                should the website have? Should it be dynamic and self-serving? These are things that matter a lot when
                it comes to the number of hours it takes to develop the website, which in turn is related to the end
                price.

                It is important to plan the websites structure, menus and ease of use. When visitors get to the website,
                the content must be appealing enough to keep exploring the page. Good texts are important for getting
                traffic from the search engines as well as creating engagement about your products / services. These
                texts are something you should develop yourself since you know the company and the products / services
                the best.

                When it comes to design, there should be some thought behind choosing colors, fonts and images so that
                the content fits your brand and business. Your website will need tailor made code based on your wishes
                given the things mentioned above. So that the website works quickly and does not crash / cause errors.

                There are dozens of different browsers running on Macs and PCs that all need customization. All the
                browsers treat the code a bit differently, which can result in inequality in appearance. This means
                coding, testing, and fixing of the entire website to ensure a good experience no matter which browser
                the visitor is using. The site also have to be optimized for mobile devices like tablets and smart
                phones as they make up a large proportion of the internet traffic. This means I have to make sure that
                the website looks good on different display sizes.

                Although a website consists of digital images and text, it must exist on a physical machine. Tasks like
                setting up DNS, installing your site on a physical server, and making sure everything works, is also
                part of the work when developing a website.

                There is a long list of things that must be done to get you the best possible website. I have not listed
                them all to make it easier for me to justify a big price tag on the development of a website. It is
                simply to provide a better understanding of the tasks a web developer needs to perform in developing a
                website.
